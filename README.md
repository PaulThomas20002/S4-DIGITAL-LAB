# S4-DIGITAL-LAB
 This course helps the learners to get familiarized with (i) Digital Logic Design through the implementation of Logic Circuits using ICs of basic logic gates &amp; flipflops and (ii) Hardware Description Language based Digital Design. This course helps the learners to design and implement hardware systems in areas such as games, music, digital filters, wireless communications and graphical displays. Prerequisite : Topics covered under the course Logic System Design (CST 203) 
<h3>SYLLABUS</h3>
Conduct a minimum of 8 experiments from Part A and a minimum of 4 experiments from
Part B. The starred experiments in Part A are mandatory. The lab work should be conducted
in groups (maximum group size being 4). The performance of a student in the group should
be assessed based on teamwork, integrity and cooperation.
